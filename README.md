## 🎯 Core Thesis

Reality is not substance (noun) but action (verb). The universe is energy-as-verb-coin conjugating according to mathematical grammar, building complexity through recursive pattern formation—from quantum fields to consciousness—without requiring design, intention, or consciousness at the foundation.
