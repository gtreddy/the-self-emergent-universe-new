# Chapter 6: Biology—When Chemistry Became Self-Sustaining

## Introduction: The Most Profound Recursion

We have traced recursion from energy to atoms to molecules to planets. Now we encounter the most remarkable recursive transition in cosmic history: **Chemistry that maintains and copies itself.**

Life is not a new substance added to chemistry. Life is **chemistry organized into self-maintaining, self-replicating cycles**—molecular patterns that persist by continuously rebuilding themselves from surrounding materials.

This chapter shows how life emerged through purely recursive chemical processes:
- No vital force required (élan vital rejected)
- No consciousness directing it (emerges billions of years before minds)
- No design or purpose (just chemistry + energy + selection)
- No violation of physics (fully consistent with thermodynamics)

**The key insight**: Life is what happens when molecular recursion crosses a threshold—when reaction networks become **autocatalytic** (self-promoting), when information storage becomes **heritable** (copied to offspring), when variation becomes **selectable** (differential reproduction).

**Three essential features**:
1. **Metabolism**: Energy flows through chemical cycles (maintaining the pattern)
2. **Reproduction**: Pattern copies itself (information inherited)
3. **Evolution**: Copying errors + selection → adaptation (recursive improvement)

All three emerge from chemistry operating in the grammar generated by electromagnetic forces at molecular scales, in the space-time of planetary surfaces, powered by energy gradients (sunlight, chemical disequilibrium, thermal vents).

No new principles needed. Same verb-coin framework. Same force-generated grammar. Just higher-level recursion.

## The Chemistry of Early Earth (4.5 to 3.8 Billion Years Ago)

### Earth's Formation and Early Conditions

**4.5 billion years ago**: Earth coalesces from planetesimals
- Hot, molten surface (impacts release enormous gravitational energy)
- No solid crust yet
- No atmosphere (any primordial gases lost to space)
- No water on surface (too hot, evaporated)

**4.4 billion years ago**: Surface begins cooling
- Crust solidifies (igneous rock)
- Water vapor condenses → oceans form
- Atmosphere accumulates from volcanic outgassing:
  - H₂O (water vapor)
  - CO₂ (carbon dioxide)
  - N₂ (nitrogen)
  - CH₄ (methane)
  - NH₃ (ammonia)
  - H₂S (hydrogen sulfide)
  - **No free O₂ yet** (oxygen comes later from photosynthesis)

**4.1-3.8 billion years ago**: Late Heavy Bombardment
- Intense meteor impacts
- Water delivered (comets, asteroids)
- Organic molecules delivered (found in meteorites)
- Tidal pools, hydrothermal vents form

**By 3.8 billion years ago**:
- Liquid water oceans exist
- Continental crust forming
- Volcanic activity providing energy and chemicals
- UV radiation intense (no ozone layer yet)
- Conditions suitable for organic chemistry

### Energy Sources for Chemical Synthesis

**Life requires energy to build complex molecules from simple precursors.**

Early Earth had multiple energy sources:

**1. UV radiation** (from young Sun):
- No ozone layer → intense UV reaches surface
- UV photons break chemical bonds
- Drives synthesis of organic molecules
- Energy: ~10-100 eV per photon

**2. Lightning** (atmospheric electrical discharge):
- Estimated 10⁹-10¹⁰ lightning strikes per year
- Each strike: ~10⁹ joules
- Creates plasma (temperatures ~30,000 K)
- Drives nitrogen fixation, organic synthesis

**3. Volcanic activity** (geothermal energy):
- Heat from Earth's interior
- Temperatures: 100-400°C at vents
- Chemical energy from reduced minerals (H₂, Fe²⁺, S²⁻)
- Continuous, reliable energy source

**4. Impacts** (asteroid/comet collisions):
- Enormous energy release
- Temperatures > 5000 K
- Create shock-synthesized organics
- Declining frequency over time

**5. Radioactive decay** (in Earth's crust):
- Uranium, thorium, potassium isotopes
- Steady heat production
- Powers geothermal systems

**Verb-coin interpretation**:
- All energy sources: Face-1 (kinetic energy) available to drive chemical reactions
- Molecules in face-0 (potential energy of stable bonds)
- Energy input: Drives face-0 → face-1 transitions (breaking bonds)
- Followed by: Face-1 → face-0 (forming new, more complex bonds)
- Net result: Simple molecules → complex organic molecules

### The Building Blocks: Prebiotic Synthesis

**Key question**: Do organic molecules form naturally under early Earth conditions?

**Miller-Urey Experiment (1953)**:
- Simulated early Earth atmosphere: CH₄, NH₃, H₂O, H₂
- Energy source: Electric spark (simulating lightning)
- Ran for one week
- **Results**: Produced amino acids (glycine, alanine), hydroxy acids, urea
- **Significance**: Proved organic molecules form spontaneously from inorganic precursors

**Since then, expanded experiments**:
- Different atmospheric compositions (CO₂, N₂ dominant)
- Different energy sources (UV, heat, shock waves)
- Always produce organic molecules:
  - **Amino acids**: 20+ varieties (building blocks of proteins)
  - **Nucleobases**: Adenine, guanine, cytosine, thymine, uracil (DNA/RNA components)
  - **Sugars**: Ribose, glucose (energy storage, nucleic acid backbones)
  - **Fatty acids**: Long carbon chains (membrane components)

**Found in meteorites** (carbonaceous chondrites):
- **Murchison meteorite** (1969): 
  - 70+ amino acids (only 19 overlap with biology)
  - Nucleobases (adenine, guanine)
  - Sugars, sugar alcohols
- **Confirms**: Organic synthesis occurs throughout universe, not just Earth

**Mechanisms of synthesis**:

**Formose reaction** (sugars from formaldehyde):
- H₂CO (formaldehyde) + H₂CO → sugars (including ribose)
- Autocatalytic (products catalyze their own formation)
- Works in alkaline conditions

**HCN polymerization** (nucleobases from hydrogen cyanide):
- 5 HCN → adenine (A, one of DNA bases)
- Works in concentrated solutions
- UV catalyzed

**Fischer-Tropsch synthesis** (hydrocarbons from CO + H₂):
- Occurs at hydrothermal vents
- Iron-sulfur minerals catalyze
- Produces organic molecules from volcanic gases

**Verb-coin interpretation**:
- Simple molecules (H₂O, CH₄, NH₃, CO₂): Low-energy face-0 states
- Energy input (lightning, UV): Forces face-1 transitions
- Unstable intermediates: High-energy face-0 states
- Recombination: New face-0 states (organic molecules)
- Some products more stable than reactants → accumulate
- Grammar: Organic chemistry rules (carbon bonding, functional groups)

**Result**: Early Earth's oceans contained "primordial soup"—dilute mixture of organic molecules. Concentration mechanisms (tidal pools, mineral surfaces, ice) created localized high concentrations.

## The RNA World: Information and Catalysis Combined

### The Chicken-and-Egg Problem

**Modern life requires**:
- **DNA**: Stores genetic information (stable, double-stranded)
- **RNA**: Transfers information, intermediate (less stable, single-stranded)
- **Proteins**: Do the work (enzymes, structures)

**Problem**:
- DNA needs proteins to replicate (enzymes)
- Proteins need DNA for their sequence information
- Which came first? Neither can function without the other!

**RNA World Hypothesis**: RNA came first, doing both jobs
- RNA can store information (like DNA)
- RNA can catalyze reactions (like proteins)
- RNA simpler than DNA+proteins system
- RNA → RNA/DNA/proteins later

### RNA as Catalyst: Ribozymes

**Discovery (1980s, Thomas Cech and Sidney Altman)**:
- Some RNA molecules catalyze reactions
- Called "ribozymes" (RNA enzymes)
- Nobel Prize 1989

**Examples of ribozymes**:

**Group I intron** (self-splicing RNA):
- Cuts itself out of precursor RNA
- Rejoins flanking sequences
- No protein needed

**RNase P** (cleaves tRNA precursors):
- RNA component is catalytic
- Protein components enhance but not essential

**Ribosome** (makes proteins):
- Catalytic site is RNA, not protein!
- 23S rRNA (ribosomal RNA) catalyzes peptide bond formation
- Proteins provide structural support
- **The ribosome is a ribozyme**—RNA catalyzing protein synthesis

**Peptidyl transferase center**:
- Active site: RNA nucleotides, no amino acids
- Mechanism: RNA positions substrates, activates reaction
- Proves: RNA capable of sophisticated catalysis

**Why this matters**:
- Shows RNA can perform enzymatic functions
- Suggests early life could use RNA alone
- DNA and proteins evolved later (more specialized)

### RNA as Information Storage

**RNA can encode information** like DNA:
- Four bases: A, U, G, C (DNA has T instead of U)
- Linear sequence: Each base is one "letter"
- Can be copied: Base pairing rules (A-U, G-C)

**Template-directed synthesis**:
- Single RNA strand serves as template
- Complementary strand assembles: A pairs with U, G with C
- Result: Two complementary strands
- Separate: Each can template another copy

**Problem**: No enzymes to copy RNA (yet)

**Solution**: RNA can catalyze its own replication (in principle)
- **RNA polymerase ribozyme**: RNA that copies RNA
- Demonstrated in lab (Bartel & Szostak, 2001)
- Not yet perfect, but functional
- Shows concept viable

### The First Replicators

**Scenario**:

**Step 1**: Random RNA sequences form (from nucleotides in primordial soup)
- Chance assembly in concentrated pools
- Most sequences do nothing
- Rare sequences: Catalytic activity

**Step 2**: Some RNA sequences catalyze reactions
- Including their own synthesis (autocatalytic)
- These sequences accumulate (positive feedback)
- Others degrade faster than they form

**Step 3**: Template-directed copying emerges
- Complementary base pairing
- One RNA strand templates another
- Now: Information can be inherited

**Step 4**: Darwinian evolution begins
- Variants arise (copying errors)
- Some replicate faster than others
- Faster replicators dominate
- Selection for: Better catalysis, faster replication, more stability

**Hypercycle**: Mutually catalytic RNA molecules
- RNA₁ helps make RNA₂
- RNA₂ helps make RNA₃
- RNA₃ helps make RNA₁
- Cycle is self-reinforcing
- More stable than individual replicators

**Verb-coin interpretation**:
- RNA sequences: Standing patterns (specific molecular structures)
- Catalytic activity: Lowering activation energy (face-0 barrier reduction)
- Replication: Pattern copying pattern (recursive self-production)
- Selection: Differential persistence (stable patterns outlast unstable)
- Grammar: Organic chemistry + thermodynamics determine which sequences stable/catalytic

### Compartmentalization: The First Cells

**Problem**: Replicators need containment
- In open ocean: Products diffuse away
- Competition: Other molecules interfere
- Solution: Enclosure in membrane

**Lipid vesicles** (protocells):
- Fatty acids self-assemble into spherical bilayers
- Hydrophobic tails inside, hydrophilic heads out
- Enclose RNA molecules
- Semi-permeable: Small molecules enter, large molecules trapped

**Advantages of compartmentalization**:
1. **Concentration**: Keep products of reactions together
2. **Identity**: Each protocell has distinct RNA content
3. **Heritability**: Daughter vesicles inherit parent's RNA
4. **Competition**: Protocells compete, not individual molecules
5. **Selection**: Better protocells grow, divide faster

**Division**:
- Add more lipids → membrane grows
- Mechanical stress → splits into two
- Each daughter gets some RNA
- Simple, passive process (no complex machinery yet)

**The first "cells"**:
- Lipid membrane (boundary)
- RNA genome (information)
- Ribozymes (catalysis)
- Simple metabolism (chemical reactions)
- Can grow, divide, evolve

**Not yet alive** (by modern standards), but:
- Self-maintaining (reactions sustain the system)
- Self-replicating (divide into daughters)
- Evolvable (variants compete)

**This is the threshold**: Chemistry becomes biology when self-maintaining, self-replicating, evolvable systems emerge.

## The Transition to DNA and Proteins

### Why DNA?

**RNA problems**:
- Less chemically stable (2'-OH group vulnerable)
- Degrades faster in water
- Harder to maintain long-term information

**DNA advantages**:
- More stable (lacks 2'-OH)
- Double-stranded (error checking via base pairing)
- Better long-term information storage

**Transition**:
- Enzymes evolve to make DNA from RNA (reverse transcriptase analogs)
- DNA becomes primary information storage
- RNA remains in intermediate roles (mRNA, tRNA, rRNA)

### Why Proteins?

**RNA catalysis limitations**:
- Only 4 building blocks (A, U, G, C)
- Limited chemical diversity
- Catalytic efficiency lower than proteins

**Protein advantages**:
- 20 amino acids (much greater chemical diversity)
- More functional groups (acidic, basic, polar, nonpolar, aromatic)
- Can form more complex 3D structures
- More efficient enzymes

**Transition**:
- Ribosomes evolve (RNA-based protein makers)
- Genetic code emerges (triplet codons → amino acids)
- Proteins take over most catalytic functions
- DNA stores information, RNA transfers, proteins work

**The Central Dogma** (modern biology):
```
DNA → RNA → Protein
(storage) (transfer) (function)
```

**But historically**:
```
RNA (does everything)
 ↓
RNA + Proteins (division of labor begins)
 ↓
DNA + RNA + Proteins (specialization complete)
```

## LUCA: The Last Universal Common Ancestor

### Evidence for Common Ancestry

**All life on Earth shares**:
- DNA (same genetic code with minor variations)
- RNA (mRNA, tRNA, rRNA)
- Ribosomes (protein synthesis machinery)
- ATP (energy currency)
- 20 standard amino acids (proteins)
- Same biochemical pathways (glycolysis, etc.)
- Cell membrane (lipid bilayer)

**This cannot be coincidence**. All life descended from common ancestor.

**Phylogenetic tree** (from comparing genes):
```
                    LUCA
                   /     \
                  /       \
              Bacteria   Archaea
                            \
                             \
                           Eukaryotes
                           (includes us)
```

**Three domains**:
- **Bacteria**: Most familiar microbes (E. coli, cyanobacteria)
- **Archaea**: Often extremophiles (methanogens, thermophiles)
- **Eukaryotes**: Complex cells with nuclei (animals, plants, fungi, protists)

### What Was LUCA Like?

**By comparing all three domains**, we infer LUCA's characteristics:

**Genetic system**:
- DNA genome
- RNA intermediates
- Ribosomal protein synthesis
- Universal genetic code

**Metabolism**:
- Used ATP (energy currency)
- Had electron transport chains
- Likely chemolithoautotroph (energy from inorganic chemicals, CO₂ as carbon source)
- Possibly lived near hydrothermal vents

**Cell structure**:
- Cell membrane (lipid bilayer)
- No nucleus (prokaryotic)
- Molecular machinery (ribosomes, enzymes)

**Environment**:
- Probably high temperature (thermophilic—heat-loving)
- Possibly high pressure (deep ocean vent)
- Anaerobic (no oxygen yet)

**When**: ~3.5-3.8 billion years ago

**LUCA was not the first life**:
- Already sophisticated (DNA, ribosomes, complex metabolism)
- Billions of years of evolution before LUCA
- Earlier, simpler organisms existed but left no descendants
- LUCA: Survivor that out-competed all others

**Timeline**:
- 4.5 Ga: Earth forms
- 4.4 Ga: Oceans form
- 4.1-3.8 Ga: Late Heavy Bombardment
- ~4.0 Ga: First replicators? (RNA world)
- ~3.8 Ga: LUCA (earliest fossil evidence ambiguous)
- ~3.5 Ga: Clear fossil evidence (stromatolites)

## Evolution: The Recursive Algorithm

### The Mechanism

**Evolution is recursion operating on biological patterns**:

1. **Reproduction**: Organisms copy themselves (pattern copying pattern)
2. **Variation**: Copying errors occur (mutations)
3. **Selection**: Some variants survive/reproduce better
4. **Inheritance**: Successful variants pass traits to offspring
5. **Accumulation**: Advantageous changes accumulate over generations
6. **Repeat**: Cycle continues indefinitely

**This is algorithmic**:
```
WHILE (organisms exist) {
  Reproduce (with variation);
  Select (differential survival/reproduction);
  Inherit (pass traits to next generation);
}
```

**No consciousness directing it**. No goal. No foresight. Just:
- Random variation (mutations don't "know" what's beneficial)
- Differential reproduction (better-adapted organisms leave more offspring)
- Time (billions of years of iterations)

### Sources of Variation

**Mutations** (copying errors):
- DNA replication: ~10⁻⁹ errors per base pair per generation (after proofreading)
- Result: New alleles (gene variants)
- Most neutral or harmful, rare beneficial

**Recombination** (sexual reproduction):
- Shuffles existing alleles into new combinations
- Increases variation without new mutations
- Accelerates adaptation

**Gene duplication**:
- Whole gene copied
- One copy maintains original function
- Duplicate free to evolve new function
- Source of evolutionary innovation

**Horizontal gene transfer** (bacteria):
- DNA transferred between organisms (not parent→offspring)
- Rapid spread of advantageous genes
- Example: Antibiotic resistance

### Natural Selection

**Key insight** (Darwin, 1859):
- Organisms produce more offspring than can survive
- Offspring vary in traits
- Traits that enhance survival/reproduction become more common
- Over time: Population evolves (changes trait frequencies)

**Example—Antibiotic resistance**:
1. Bacterial population exposed to antibiotic
2. Most die, but rare mutants resistant (random pre-existing variation)
3. Resistant bacteria survive, reproduce
4. Next generation: Higher percentage resistant
5. Repeat: Eventually entire population resistant

**Not goal-directed**: Bacteria didn't "try" to become resistant. Random mutations created variation, antibiotic selected winners.

**Selection types**:

**Directional**: Environment favors one extreme
- Example: Larger body size in changing climate
- Population mean shifts over time

**Stabilizing**: Environment favors average
- Example: Birth weight in humans (too small or large = higher mortality)
- Extremes selected against

**Disruptive**: Environment favors both extremes
- Example: Beak sizes matching available seed sizes
- Can lead to speciation

**Sexual selection**: Mate choice drives evolution
- Example: Peacock tail (costly but attractive to females)
- Can be maladaptive for survival but enhances reproduction

### Speciation: How New Species Arise

**Species**: Group of organisms that can interbreed and produce fertile offspring

**Reproductive isolation**: When populations can't interbreed

**Mechanisms**:

**Geographic isolation** (allopatric speciation):
- Population splits (mountain range, river, ocean)
- Each population evolves independently
- Eventually: Too different to interbreed
- Example: Darwin's finches (different Galápagos islands)

**Ecological isolation** (sympatric speciation):
- Populations in same area specialize on different resources
- Assortative mating (mate with similar individuals)
- Divergence without geographic barrier
- Example: Cichlid fish in same lake

**Polyploidy** (instant speciation in plants):
- Chromosome doubling
- Offspring can't breed with parents (wrong chromosome number)
- New species in one generation

**Timescale**:
- Speciation: 10,000s to millions of years (typically)
- Observed in real-time: Ring species, incipient speciation
- Fossil record: Millions of species over billions of years

## Major Evolutionary Transitions

### Prokaryotes to Eukaryotes (~2 Billion Years Ago)

**Prokaryotes** (bacteria, archaea):
- No nucleus
- DNA in cytoplasm
- Small (1-10 μm)
- Simple internal structure

**Eukaryotes** (animals, plants, fungi, protists):
- Nucleus (DNA enclosed)
- Organelles (mitochondria, chloroplasts)
- Larger (10-100 μm)
- Complex internal structure

**Endosymbiosis theory** (Lynn Margulis):
- Mitochondria: Descended from bacteria engulfed by ancestral eukaryote
- Chloroplasts: Descended from cyanobacteria engulfed by ancestral plant
- Evidence:
  - Mitochondria/chloroplasts have own DNA (circular, like bacteria)
  - Have own ribosomes (70S, like bacteria, not 80S like eukaryotes)
  - Replicate independently
  - Double membrane (inner from bacterium, outer from host)
  - Phylogenetic analysis confirms bacterial ancestry

**Why crucial**:
- Mitochondria: Efficient ATP production (aerobic respiration)
- Enabled larger, more complex cells
- Foundation for multicellular life

### Single-Cell to Multicellular (~1 Billion Years Ago)

**Advantages of multicellularity**:
- Specialization (different cells do different jobs)
- Larger size (escape predation, new niches)
- Efficiency (division of labor)

**Examples of transition**:
- Colonial organisms (Volvox—algae forming spheres)
- Slime molds (single cells aggregate into multicellular slug)
- Sponges (loosely organized cell collective)

**Key innovations**:
- Cell adhesion (proteins stick cells together)
- Cell communication (signaling molecules)
- Cell differentiation (same genome, different gene expression)
- Programmed cell death (apoptosis—remove unnecessary cells)

**Evolved independently multiple times**:
- Animals
- Plants
- Fungi
- Various algae
- Proves: Transition not unlikely, happens repeatedly

### Cambrian Explosion (~540 Million Years Ago)

**Observation**: Sudden (geologically) appearance of diverse animal body plans

**Before Cambrian**:
- Mostly simple organisms (microbes, sponges, simple worms)
- Ediacaran fauna (strange, soft-bodied)

**During Cambrian** (540-520 Ma):
- All modern animal phyla appear in fossil record
- Hard shells, skeletons (fossilize well)
- Complex predators and prey
- Eyes, limbs, jaws

**Why?**:
- Oxygen levels rose (from photosynthesis accumulation)
- Enabled larger, more active animals
- Predation pressure (arms race)
- HOX genes (developmental toolkit for body plans)
- Snowball Earth glaciations ended

**Not creation**: Evolutionary radiation (rapid diversification)
- Ancestors existed earlier (molecular clock studies)
- Fossil preservation improved (hard parts)
- Ecological opportunity (empty niches)

### Colonization of Land (~470 Million Years Ago)

**Challenge**: Land is harsh
- Dehydration (no water surrounding organism)
- Gravity (no buoyancy support)
- UV radiation (more intense)
- Temperature fluctuations (no buffering by water)

**Solutions evolved**:

**Plants**:
- Waxy cuticle (prevents water loss)
- Stomata (controlled gas exchange)
- Vascular tissue (xylem, phloem—water/nutrient transport)
- Roots (anchor, absorb water)
- Lignin (structural support against gravity)

**Animals**:
- Lungs (gas exchange in air)
- Skin adaptations (prevent dehydration)
- Internal skeleton (support against gravity)
- Limbs (locomotion on land)
- Eggs with shells (embryo protection from drying)

**Sequence**:
1. Plants colonize land (~470 Ma)
2. Arthropods follow (~450 Ma, eating plants)
3. Vertebrates emerge from water (~365 Ma, tetrapods)
4. Terrestrial ecosystems develop

**Enabled**:
- Dinosaurs (dominant land animals for 180 million years)
- Mammals (eventually dominant after dinosaur extinction)
- Birds (descended from dinosaurs)
- Flowering plants (coevolved with insect pollinators)

---

## Evolution's Power: Evidence

### Fossil Record

**Shows**:
- Gradual change over time (transitional forms)
- Extinction events (species disappear)
- Increasing complexity (simple → complex over billions of years)

**Transitional fossils**:

**Tiktaalik** (~375 Ma):
- Fish with features of tetrapods
- Fins with wrist bones (precursors to limbs)
- Neck (fish don't have necks)
- Found exactly where predicted (Devonian rocks, former stream beds)

**Archaeopteryx** (~150 Ma):
- Dinosaur features: Teeth, clawed wings, long bony tail
- Bird features: Feathers, wishbone
- Clear transition dinosaur → bird

**Whale evolution**:
- **Pakicetus** (~50 Ma): Land mammal, carnivore
- **Ambulocetus** (~49 Ma): Amphibious, webbed feet
- **Dorudon** (~37 Ma): Fully aquatic, vestigial hind limbs
- **Modern whales**: Hind limb bones embedded in body (vestigial)

### Comparative Anatomy

**Homologous structures**: Same underlying structure, different function
- Human arm, whale flipper, bat wing, horse leg
- Same bones (humerus, radius, ulna, carpals, etc.)
- Modified for different uses
- Evidence: Common ancestry

**Vestigial structures**: Remnants of ancestral features
- Human tailbone (coccyx—vestigial tail)
- Whale hip bones (vestigial hind limbs)
- Snake pelvic bones (lost limbs)
- Human appendix (reduced cecum)
- Cave fish eyes (lost vision)

**Why vestigial structures exist**:

Evolution modifies existing structures (doesn't redesign from scratch)
If structure loses function, selection pressure to maintain it weakens
Structure gradually reduces or disappears over generations
Unless actively maintained by selection, tends toward loss
Vestigial structures are caught mid-process of evolutionary reduction

These remnants make no sense under intelligent design (why include useless parts?) but are exactly what evolution predic
Molecular Evidence
DNA comparisons provide the most powerful evidence:
Genetic similarity correlates perfectly with relatedness:

Humans and chimpanzees: ~98.8% DNA sequence identity

Humans and gorillas: ~98.4%

Humans and orangutans: ~97%

Humans and mice: ~85% (shared genes for basic functions)

Humans and fruit flies: ~60% (core metabolic genes)


Humans and bacteria: ~7% (fundamental biochemical processes)

**Why this pattern exists**:

Common ancestry: We inherited DNA from shared ancestors

Recent divergence: Less time for mutations to accumulate → more similarity

Ancient divergence: More time for changes → less similarity

This matches the fossil record and anatomical predictions perfectly

**The molecular clock**:

Mutations accumulate at roughly constant rates

Can estimate when species diverged by counting differences

Calibrated using fossil dates for known splits

Example: Human-chimp split estimated at 6-7 million years ago (matches fossil evidence)

Pseudogenes (broken genes that prove common ancestry):

Genes that no longer function due to disabling mutations

**Example**: Vitamin C synthesis gene (GULO)

Works in most mammals (they make their own vitamin C)

Broken in all primates (we need vitamin C from diet)

Same breakage in same location in all primates

Only explanation: Inherited broken gene from common ancestor

If separately created: Why would designer give us same broken gene?
